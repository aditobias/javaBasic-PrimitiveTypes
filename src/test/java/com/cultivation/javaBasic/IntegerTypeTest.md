## should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type()

1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-lang-integer-class-java/
2. Why the test failed at first?
* Because the value set to the maximumSymbol and minimumSymbol are set to 0.
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Based on the knowledge point, there is a default value for the maximum and minimum value for Integer.
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No other concerns
