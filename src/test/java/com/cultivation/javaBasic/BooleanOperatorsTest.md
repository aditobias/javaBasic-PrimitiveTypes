## void should_perform_logical_boolean_operations()

1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
* https://www.javatpoint.com/operators-in-java
2. Why the test failed at first?
* Because the array containing the expected result was empty
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Based on the operator, I applied the operator to the data so that I can come up with the boolean result.
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No other concerns

## void should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation()

1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-java/
2. Why the test failed at first?
* Because the result is 0
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Based on the AND operator, the expected value should be like the && operator. If the value is 1 (true) and it is paired with 1 (true), then the expected result is 1 (true). If the value is 0 (false) and the other value is 1 (true), the result should be 0 (false).

## void should_do_bitwise_or_boolean_operation()

1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-java/
2. Why the test failed at first?
* Because the result is 0
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Based on the OR operator, the expected value should be like the || operator. If the value is 1 (true) and it is paired with 1 (true), then the expected result is 1 (true). If the value is 0 (false) and the other value is 1 (true), the result should be 1 (true). It will always be true as long as the other value is true.

## void should_do_bitwise_not_operation()

1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-java/
2. Why the test failed at first?
* Because the result is 0
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Based on the NOT operator, the expected value should be the opposite of the current value. If the value is 1 (true), then if the NOT operator is applied then it will become 0 (true).
